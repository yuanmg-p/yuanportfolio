        I am Yuan Mig S. Paray, a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science 
        2nd year student in University Immaculate of Conception. I am 20 
        years old. I lived in St. Joseph Homes Sirawan Toril Davao City. 
        I like to play guitar instrument and I like to edit videos because 
        it helps me to cope up with stress from different problems. I like 
        to eat pizza, burger, lasagna and more. I love to visit Japan.
        I'm also want to become a successful Full Stack Developer. I'm also
        want to work in different country except in the Philippines. I want to support
        my family for their happiness like they supported since I was a baby until now.
        Before choosing this course, I have 5 options which is Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering
        Mass Communication, Musician or Sound Engineer and lastly, Information Technology or Computer Science.
        I chose Computer Science because I believed I can finish this course even it is difficult and 
        I love to design website, also wanted to learn backend website so bad. I hope I can finish this someday and
        that is my <b>Law of Attraction</b>. That's all, Thank you.
